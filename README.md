💡 WHO AM I? 💡

I am a real full-stack developer with both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in web development.

I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays.
That’s why I chose freelance web development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.

It’s easy to find people promising everything and delivering almost nothing.
My major strengths are in giving realistic promises, being responsive and responsible.
So I am not a pure geek thinking about technology only but, first, a making-things happen person.
I can assure you that I can work full time in the client timezone.
I would help my clients to grow stronger and would grow with my clients.
